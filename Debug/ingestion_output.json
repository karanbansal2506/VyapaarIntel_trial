I am so shocked and disappointed that this is happening at GOAT too. I did a search on this subreddit after reading your post, and see that this has happened in the past with GOAT. \n\nI hope GOAT has security cameras monitoring their employees so they can find out what really happened with your pair. From reading your post it seems very likely that there is a group of employees at GOAT that are working together to scam sellers out of high-value sneakers. Everything seems so fishy. I for one will be weary of selling any high-value sneakers on GOAT until I see that they’ve remedied your situation and they install better controls and monitoring of their employees to ensure stuff like this does not happen going forward.  These employees are relying on sellers just letting stuff go, but I applaud all your efforts to use all these avenues to press your case.  It’s unfortunate that it takes this much work to get the right people at GOAT’s attention. They seriously need to install a customer service telephone number as a start. \n\nI feel so horrible that you are going through this, and hope that GOAT takes ownership of this issue and remedies you in full. Please keep us posted on any developments!!!",

They don’t care enough to change it I guess because it’s been an ongoing issue for years now. \n\nThe most suspicious part for me is that they were out for delivery and now there’s not even any sign on their side of that being the case. They just think it was processed at the hub and that’s all. That’s wild to me that even their system is that bad that they can’t see it was erased from the tracking.",
